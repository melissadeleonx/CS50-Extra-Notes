<h2>Data types and variables</h2>
<p>Data types and variables are unique to C.
Modern languages like PHP and JavaScript which we'll also see a little later on in the course don't actually have to specify the data type of a variable
when you use it.
You just declare it and start using it.
If it's an integer, it knows it's an integer.
If it's a character, it knows it's a character.
If it's a word, it knows it's a string, so-called.</p>

<p>In C, which is an older language, we need to specify the data type of every variable
that we create the first time that we use that variable.
So C comes with some built-in data types.</p>
    <!-- provide an image comparing C to other languages -->
<h3>Int</h3>
<p><strong><i>The first is int.</i></strong>
The int data type is used for variables that will store integer values.
So 1, 2, 3, negative 1, 2, 3, and so on.
Integers always take up four bytes of memory, which is 32 bits.
There are eight bits in a byte
Extra Notes: 1 byte = 8 bits
Characters like letters are represented using 8 bits
see ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) as reference</p>
<!-- Add url for ASCII -->
    
<p>The range of values that an integer can store
is limited by what can fit within 32 bits' worth of information.
Negative integers and positive integers, each getting half of the range.
So the range of values that we represent with an integer ranges from negative 2
to the 31st power to 2 to the 31st power minus 1
We always need a spot for 0.
And roughly here, this is about negative 2 billion to about positive 2 billion.
Give or take a couple hundred million.
So that's what you can fit in an integer variable.</p>

<h3>Unsigned integer</h3>
<p>Now <strong><i>unsigned</i></strong> ints are not a separate type of variable.
Rather, unsigned is what's called a qualifier. It modifies the data type of integer slightly.
In this case, you can also use unsigned other data types, not only integers.
What it effectively does is double the positive range of values
that an integer can take on at the expense of no longer allowing
you to take on negative values.
</p>
<p>So if you have numbers that you know will get higher than 2 billion but less
than 4 billion, for example 2 to the 32nd power.
You might want to use an unsigned int if you know your value will never be negative.
The range of values that you can represent with an unsigned integer
as to a regular integer,
are 0 to 2 to the 32nd power minus 1, or approximately 0 to 4 billion.
So you've effectively doubled the positive range that you can fit,
but you've given up all the negative values.</p>
<p>Unsigned is not the only <strong><i>qualifier</i></strong> that we might see for variable data types.
There are also things called <i>short and long and const</i>.
These topics will be discussed later in the course</p>

<h3>Chars</h3>
<p>So chars are used for variables that will store single characters.
<strong><i>Char</i></strong> is short for character.
And sometimes you might hear people pronounce it as <i>car</i>.</p>
Characters always take up one byte of memory, which is just 8 bits.
This means that they can only fit values in the range of negative 2
to the seventh power,
or negative 128, to 2 to the 7th power minus 1, or 127.</p>
    
<p>
    Thanks to <strong>ASCII</strong>, it was long ago decided a way to map those positive numbers
    from 0 to 127 to various characters that all exist on our keyboard.
    So as we'll see later on in the course, probably come to memorize at some point,
    capital A, maps to the number 65
    And the reason for that is because that's what it's been assigned by the ASCII standard.
    Lowercase A is 97.
    The character 0 for when you actually type the character, not
    representing the number zero, is 48.</p>

<h3>Floating point numbers</h3>
<p><strong><i>Floating point numbers</i></strong>are also known as real numbers.
    They're basically numbers that have a <strong><i>decimal point</i></strong> in them.
    Floating point values like integers are also contained within 4 bytes of memory.
    There's no number line because describing the range of a float isn't exactly clear or intuitive.</p>

<p>
    Suffice it to say you have 32 bits to work with.
    And if you have a number like pi, which has an integer part 3, 
    and a floating point part, or decimal part 0.14159, and so on, 
    you need to be able to represent all of it-the integer part and the decimal part.</p>

<p><i>One thing is that if the decimal part gets longer and longer,
if I have a very large integer part,
I might notbe able to be as precise with the decimal part.
And that's really the limitation of a float. Floats have a precision problem.</i></p>

<p>
    We only have 32 bits to work with, so we can only be so precise with our decimal part.
    We can't necessarily have a decimal part precise to 100 or 200 digits,
    because we only have 32 bits to work with. So that's a limitation of a float.
    Now fortunately there's another data type called double, which somewhat deals with this problem.
</p>

<h3>Doubles</h3>
<p><strong><i>Doubles</i></strong>, like floats, are also used to store real numbers, or floating point
    values.
    The difference is that doubles are double precision.
    They can fit 64 bits of data, or eight bytes.
    It means we can be a lot more precise with the decimal point.
    <!-- Cite the pi formula with illustration. Instead of having pi to seven places maybe, with a float,
    we can maybe have it to 30 places.-->
    If that's important, you might want to use a double instead of a float.
    If you're working on a long decimal place and a lot of precision is important
    you probably want to use a double overfloat.
    Now for most of your work in CS50, a float should suffice.
    But do know that doubles exist as a way to somewhat deal with the precision
    problem by giving you an extra 32 bits to work with for your numbers.
</p>
<h3><i>Void</i>(Not a Datatype, only a Type)</h3>
<p><strong><i>Void is a type.</i></strong> It does exist. But it is not a data type.
    We can't create a variable of type void and assign a value to it.
    But <strong><i>functions</i></strong>(which will be discussed on Week 2), for example, can have a void return type.<br>
    If you see a function that has a void return type,
    it means it doesn't return a value.
    <!--Insert an image of the common function that we've used so far in CS50 that doesn't return a value?-->
    <h4>Examples of common Functions that does not return a value</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Printf:</strong> It does not actually return anything to you.
            It prints something to the screen,a side effect of what printf does.
            But it doesn't give you a value back. You don't capture the result
            and store it in some variable to use it later on.
            It just prints something to the screen and you're done.
            So we say that printf is a void function. It returns nothing. </li>
        <li><strong>Perimeter list of a function(<i>Int main (void)</i>):</strong>
            Does that ring a bell? Basically what that means is that main doesn't take any parameters.
            There's no argument that get passed into main.
            Now later on we'll see that there is a way to pass arguments into main,
            but so far what we've seen is int main void.<br>
            Main just doesn't take any arguments. And so we specify that by saying void.
            We're just being very explicit about the fact that it doesn't take any arguments.
            So for now, suffice it to say that void basically should just serve as a placeholder for you as thinking about as nothing.
            It's not really doing anything.
            There's no return value here.
            There's no parameters here.
            It's void.<br>
            It's a little more complex than that.
            But this should suffice for the better part of the course.
            And hopefully now you have a little bit more of a concept of what void is.</li>
        <li><strong>New functions you create:</strong> Throughout the course, we will implementing our own functions to support our coded programs</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <p><p class="centered-paragraph"><i>So those are the five data types you'll encounter that are built-in to C. But in CS50, we also have a library.
        The <strong>CS50.h</strong>, which you can include on your code and which will provide you with two additional types
        that you'll probably be able to use on your assignments, or just working generally in programming.
    </i>
    </p>
<h3>Bool or Boolean data type</h3>
<p>
    The first of these is <strong><i>bool</i></strong>. It is used for variables that will store a Boolean value.
    If you've ever heard this term before, you might know that a Boolean value is capable of only
    holding two different distinct values. <strong>True</strong> and <strong>False</strong><br>
    Now this seems pretty fundamental, right? It's kind of a surprise that this doesn't exist in C as it's built-in.
    And in many modern languages, of course, Booleans are a standard default data type. But in C, they're actually not. But we've created it for you. So if you ever need to create a variable whose type is bool,
    just be sure to #include CS50.h at the beginning of your program,
    and you'll be able to create variables of the bool type.
</p>
<h3>String</h3>
<p>
    The other major data type that we provide for you in the CS50 library is <strong><i>string</i></strong>. So what is a string?<br>
    Strings are really just words. They're collections of characters. They're words. They're sentences. They're paragraphs.
    Might be whole books, even. Very short to very long series of characters.<br>
    If you need to use strings, for example, to store a word, just be sure to include CS50.h at the beginning of your program
    so you can use the string type. And then you can create variables whose data type is string.</p>
    <p>Now later on in the course, we'll also see that that's not the entire story, either.
    We'll encounter things called <strong><i>structures</i></strong>,
    which allow you to group what may be an integer and a string into one unit.
    And we can use that for some purpose, which might come in handy later on in the course.
</p>
<p>
    And we'll also learn about defined types, which allow you to <strong>create your own data types</strong>. We don't need to worry about that for now.
    But just know that that's something on the horizon, that there's a lot more to this whole type thing than I'm telling you just
    now.
</p>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>
    So now that we've learned a little bit about the basic data types and the CS50 data types, let's talk about how to work with variables and create them using these data types in our programs.
    If you want to create a variable, all you need to do is two things. 
</p>
<!--Insert an image of the things we need to do to create a variable-->
<p>
    First, you need to give it a type.<br>
    The second thing you need to do is give it a name.<br>
    Once you've done that and slapped a semicolon at the end of that line,
    you've created a variable.<br>
    For examples: <strong>Int number; char letter;</strong><br>
    What have I done here? I've created two variables.<br>
    The first, the variable's name is number. And number is capable of holding integer type values, because its type is int.<br>
    Letter is another variable that can hold characters because its data type is char.
</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation where you need to create multiple variables of the same type,
    you only need to specify the type name once. Then just list as many variables of that type as you need.<br>
    For example:<br>
    Int height; new line.<br>
    Int width;<br>
    And that would work too. I'd still get two variables called height and width, each of which
    is an integer. But I'm allowed to, things to C syntax, consolidate it into a single line.
    Int height, width; It's the same thing.<br>
    I've created two variables, one called height one called width, both of which
    are capable of holding integer type values.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly here, I can create three floating point values at once.
    For examples: float squareRoot2, squareRoot3, pi;<br>
    We can also do this on three separate lines and that would work too.<br>
    float squareRoot2;<br>
    float squareRoot3;<br>
    float pi;<br>
    We can consolidate this into a single line of code. Makes things a little bit shorter, not as clunky.</p>
<p> Now in general, it's good design to only declare a variable when you need it.
    And we'll talk a little bit more about that
    later on in the course when we discuss <strong><i>scope</i></strong>.
    So we don't necessarily need to create all of our variables
    at the beginning of the program, which some people might have done the past,
    or was certainly a very common coding practice many years ago
    when working with C. You might just want to create a variable right when
    you need it.</p>
<p>So we've created variables. How do we use them? After we declare a variable, we don't need
    to specify the data type of that variable anymore. In fact, if you do so, you might end up with some weird consequences
    that we'll kind of gloss over for now. But suffice it to say, weird things are going
    to start happening if you inadvertently re-declare variables with the same name
    over and over.</p>

<p>So here I have four lines of code. And I have a couple of comments there just indicating what's happening on each line just to help
you get situated in what's going on. So the example previously,<strong>int number</strong>; is a <strong>variable declaration.</strong>
I've now created a variable called number that's capable of holding integer-type values. I've declared it.<br>
int number;<br>
number = 17; <br>
The next line I'm assigning a value to number. Number equals 17. What's happening there?<br>
I'm putting the number 17 inside of that variable. So if I ever then print out what the contents of number are later on,
they'll tell me it's 17.<br>
int number; (That's a declaration)<br>
number = 17; (That's an assignment)<br>
printf("%i", number);<br>
So I've declared a variable, and then I've assigned it. We can repeat the process again with char letter;.</p>

<p>
    Now this process might seem kind of silly.
    Why are we doing this in two lines of code?
    Is there a better way to do it?
    In fact, there is.
    Sometimes you might see this called initialization.
    It's when you declare a variable and assign a value at the same time.
    This is actually a pretty common thing to do.
    When you create a variable, you usually want it to have some basic value.
    Even if it's 0 or something.
    You just you give it a value.
    >> You can initialize a variable.
    Int number equals 17 is the same as the first two lines of code up above.
    Char letter equals h is the same as the third and fourth lines of code above.
    The most important takeaway here when we're declaring and assigning
    variables is after we've declared it, notice
    I'm not using the data type again.
    I'm not saying int number equals 17 on the second line of code, for example.
    I'm just saying number equals 17.
    >> Again , re-declaring a variable after you've already declared it can lead
    to some weird consequence.</p>
